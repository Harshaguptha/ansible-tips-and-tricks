# Ansible Tips and Tricks

## THIS SITE'S DOCUMENTATION HAS MOVED!

Please head on over to: <https://github.com/nfaction/ansible-tips-and-tricks/wiki>


This site is intended to provide code examples and snippets for Ansible.  This is not a replacement guide to Ansible, only a supplemental guide to aide in writing complete, multi-OS compatible code.  For the full Ansible documentation, please familiarize yourself with them here: <http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/index.html>

For complete examples, feel free to run any playbook in the examples on our GitHub [repository.](https://github.com/cyverse/ansible-tips-and-tricks/tree/master/examples)
